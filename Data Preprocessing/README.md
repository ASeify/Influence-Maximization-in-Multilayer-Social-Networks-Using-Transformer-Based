# Data Aggregation & Outlier Detection Toolkit

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks implementing core dataâ€‘processing workflows:

1. **Data_Aggregation.ipynb**  
   â€“ Methods to merge, clean, and summarize multiâ€‘source datasets.  
2. **Outlier_Detection.ipynb**  
   â€“ Techniques to identify and visualize outliers in numerical data.

These notebooks were developed as part of the project  
> **Influence maximization in multilayer social networks using transformerâ€‘based node embeddings and deep neural networks**  
> (Neurocomputing, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2025.130939)

## How to Run

### Data Aggregation

Place your raw CSV files into data/.

Open notebooks/Data_Aggregation.ipynb.

Follow each cell to load, merge, and output aggregated_data.csv.

### Outlier Detection

Ensure aggregated_data.csv (or any numeric dataset) is in data/.

Open notebooks/Outlier_Detection.ipynb.

Run cells to perform zâ€‘score and IQRâ€‘based outlier detection, with visualizations.
